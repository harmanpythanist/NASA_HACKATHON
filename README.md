**NASA HACKATHON 2024**

We built a project to deal with the seriousness of objects heeding toward earth. Majorly python and Wordpress are used to machine learning model and webiste implementation. 
With the usage of three columns from real life dataset: 

- Relative velocity of coming object in meters per hour
- extimated minimum diameter in meters
- Estimated maximum diameter in meters

We implemented **Random Forest** and **Logistic Regression** machine learning algorithms, both with accuracies of more than 90%. (to be more specific, we got 92 correct predictions out of 100)
